### Manual Build

git clone --recursive https://github.com/uber/horovod.git
cd horovod
python setup.py clean
python setup.py bdist_wheel

When the build process success, .whl package is in ./dist/ directory, then install:

pip install ./dist/horovod-<version>-cp27-cp27mu-linux_x86_64.whl

### Note:

bdist_wheel will build you a wheel file on that can be installed on a server with exactly the same build flags (e.g. HOROVOD_GPU_ALLREDUCE)
and version of TensorFlow, MPI, CUDA, and NCCL as the server you built the wheel on.

sdist provides source tarball that you can install on a target server with build flags and versions of dependencies available on the server
that you're installing the tarball.

Advice: Use python setup.py sdist instead of bdist_wheel, because it gives this "late binding" benefits.
